          I love Javascript and its ecosystem, most of my projects are made in
          React & Next.js. Usually, I share pieces of my experiences through
          LinkedIn or Twitter and although I&apos;m quite introverted in the
          first meeting, I love to get in touch with other devs! :) I built also
          a couple of open-source projects, available on my Github profile, and
          probably the list will grow in the future.

          I tend to read every day, at least 10 pages of entrepreneurship and
          personal-growth books, Jack Ma and Simon Sinek are currently my
          inspiration. I love watching them talk about their experiences.

          Sometimes I&apos;m also a gamer, fallen in love with Pokemon since
          I&apos;m a child, and also some more competitive games like Rocket
          League.
